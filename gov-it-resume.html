                   The FEC project revolutionized the way the FEC shares data and reimagined how citizens, journalists, and transparency seekers connect with campaign finance. We delivered the FEC’s first <a href="https://api.open.fec.gov/developers">API</a> and redesigned <a href="https://www.fec.gov">fec.gov</a> using an agile and user-centered process. Not only did FEC's <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2015/10/27/fec-updates-website-2016-election/74672832/">website improve</a>, the FEC has modernized its processes and adopted best practices like testing, source control, open source, agile and user centered design. The FEC estimates that this project <a href="http://m.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2017/03/fec-and-18f-team-save-agency-12m/136598/">saves the FEC $1.2 million a year</a> in infrastructure costs by migrating to the cloud.
